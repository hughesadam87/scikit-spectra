    polystyrene (PS) dissolved in a 50:50 blblend of metyl etyl ketone (MEK) and
    perdeuterated tolune.  The initial concentration of PS is about 1.0wt%.
    Once the solution mixture is exposed to the open atmosphere, the solvents 
    start evaporating, and the PS concentraiton increases with time.  However,
    due to the substantial difference in the volatility of MEK and toluene 
    coupled with their slightly dissimilar affinity to PS, the composition of
    the solution mixture changes as a function of time in a rather complex 
    manner during hte spontaneous evaporation process.  
    
    The transient IR spectra were collected as the two solvents evaporated, 
    eventually leaving a PS film behind, as shown schematically in Figure 4.1
    (A).  The measurement was actually made using a horizontal attenuated total 
    reflectance (ATR) prism.

    gradually decrease, while those of PS bands at 3020 and 1450cm-1 increase
