''' Suite for 2-dimensional correlation analysis based on pandas dataframes.  Decided to put it in, despite already
seeing a numpy-based version in paper "2D-correlation analysis applied to in situ and operando Mossbauer spectroscopy".
This would not be pandas friendly, so it wouldn't intgerate into pyuvvis and I also want to build some tools from 
scratch to refamiliarize myself with the topic.

To remember/writeup eventually:

From page 32 Noda book,
Classical statistical cross correlation measures the dot product between spectral variables at different times.
For example, a pulse at t=0 and again at t=3, then the cross correlation would be max at tau=3.  If this experiment
went on for 50 minutes, then we average and integrate over all time.  If this pulse happed every 3 seconds, this correlation
would be 100% for exmaple.  If the pulse happed like only 5 times, the correlation would be diluted by the normalization factor.

The synchronous spectrum is the cross correlation at tau=0, summed and averaged over all times.  Basically, it measures the instantaneous
correlation of all spectral variables.  The asynchronous spectrum is the instantaneous orthogonal spectrum basically.  So whenever two things
are moving together at one instant, weight goes into the sync.  If not, weight goes into the async  Makes me think of an easy filter!  Can
just throw out regions where not much is happening right?  Maybe call it a 2dcs filter.'''
